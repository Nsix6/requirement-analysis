# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

- Underlying structure that allows for clarity and precision durinf project execution

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, documenting, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.

some importance includes:

- Clarity – Remove ambiguity, vagueness, and conflicting statements.
- Consistency – Requirements must not contradict each other.
- Prioritization – Identify “must-haves” vs “nice-to-haves.”

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- Clarity – Remove ambiguity, vagueness, and conflicting statements.
- Consistency – Requirements must not contradict each other.
- Prioritization – Identify “must-haves” vs “nice-to-haves.”

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- Requirement Gatthering
  Goal: Discover what stakeholders really need.

How it’s done:

- Interviews with clients and end-users.
- Surveys & questionnaires for larger groups.
- Workshops & brainstorming sessions.
- Observation/job shadowing to see real workflows.
- Document analysis (policies, existing systems).
- Prototyping to clarify vague needs.

Output: A raw list of requirements (functional, non-functional, domain-specific, constraints).

- Requirement Analysis and Modelling:
  Goal: Refine, prioritize, and organize the gathered requirements.

How it’s done:

- Identify conflicts (different stakeholders want different things).
- Detect ambiguities (“system should be fast” → define fast).
- Perform feasibility checks (budget, technology, timeline).
- Prioritize (MoSCoW: Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won’t-have).
- Use modeling tools (UML, data flow diagrams, ERD, use cases).

Output: A structured, clear set of requirements ready for documentation.

- Requirement Documentation:

Goal: Write down requirements in a clear, unambiguous, testable format.

How it’s done:

- Create a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document.
- Use user stories (Agile) or use cases (traditional).
- Include both functional and non-functional requirements.

Output: An agreed-upon requirements document that acts as a contract between stakeholders and developers.

- Requirement Validation.
  Goal: Make sure requirements correctly capture what stakeholders need and are realistic.

How it’s done:

- Requirement reviews & walkthroughs with stakeholders.
- Prototypes/mockups tested by users.
- Validation against business goals.

Output: Validated requirements ready for design and development.
